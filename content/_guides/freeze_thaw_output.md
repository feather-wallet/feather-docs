Freezing an output prevents it from being spent in future transactions. Thaw is the opposite of freeze, it "unfreezes" an output and makes it available for spending again.

Go to the **Coins** tab. (**View → Coins**, if it isn't enabled).

Select the outputs you want to freeze, then right click **→ Freeze output** or **→ Thaw output**.
