### What is the primary address?

A Monero wallet has one primary address. On mainnet this address starts with a '4'.

The primary address is a valid Monero address and can be used to receive funds. (But we recommend that you don't, unless you have to!)

You may need your primary address when you are:

- [Solo-mining](mining-setup)
- [Creating a view-only wallet](create-view-only-wallet)
- Transacting with a service that does not accept subaddresses

If you are transacting with a service that does not accept addresses starting with an '8', please ask them to add support for subaddresses. This requires very little effort on their part.

### Why is the primary address hidden by default from the Receive tab?

The primary address is hidden by default to discourage address re-use.

### How can I show the primary address on the Receive tab?

Right-click the table header **→ Show change address**. You may also need to select **Show used addresses** if the address has ever received funds.

### Where can I find my primary address?

You can find it in **Wallet → Keys**.
